# photobox
Hi y'all,

this piece of code is going to be a photobox software package. The main feature is a smile based trigger which is based on the dataset of [Hromada, 2010](https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD). I'm extending that tho.

For face detection I use YuNet from https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo. It works like a charm :)

Work is still in progress and I have not cleaned up my code in a while, but I'll get to that eventually.

Timo :)
